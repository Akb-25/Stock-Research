Commenting on the results, Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries said, “Strong operational and financial contribution from all business segments has helped Reliance deliver another quarter of robust growth.
I am happy that Jio remains committed to the vision of a digital India through the launch of two innovative and transformative offerings, JioAirFiber and JioBharat phone. Based on our state-of-the-art standalone 5G network, JioAirFiber significantly expands the reach and benefit of high-speed connectivity to millions of households across India. JioBharat phone will enable digital inclusion for millions of Indians and catalyze India’s transformation to next-gen connectivity solutions. By December 2023, we will also complete the Pan-India rollout of 5G services and set a new global benchmark for the fastest roll-out of a 5G network across a large nation.
Reliance Retail has continued to rapidly expand its offline as well as online presence while adding to its already impressive range of products and offerings. We are providing a fresh and friendly shopping experience across our seamless ecosystem. The strength and diversity of our Retail business model is consistently delivering robust performance.
The resilient performance of the O2C segment despite volatility in energy markets was led by strong growth in fuel demand in a supply-constrained market. Weak global demand and supply overhang continued to impact downstream margins. The growth of oil and gas business is particularly noteworthy with production from KGD6 block ramping up and providing valuable fuel for the energy transition to the Indian economy.”
